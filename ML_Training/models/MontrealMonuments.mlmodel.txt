This is a placeholder for the Core ML model.
            
To create a real model:
1. Collect training images for Montreal landmarks
2. Run this script with actual training data
3. The script will generate a proper MontrealMonuments.mlmodel file

For now, you can test the integration by:
1. Creating a simple Core ML model using Create ML in Xcode
2. Or using a pre-trained model and adapting it
3. Make sure the model outputs match the landmark identifiers in your Swift code
